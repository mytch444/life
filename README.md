Life
====

Simple Conways Game of Life implementation in c for x11. 

Check --help for options.

At the moment the only user input is 'q' to quit, 'p' to pause and the mouse 
which when pressed will bring cells to life. Right clicking does the same but 
livens a ten by ten block instead.

Run make to compile.

Then for fun run *./life -r 10000 -w 230 -h 210 -d 20 -p* make the window full
size then press p.
